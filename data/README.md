The data in this folder contains the RAPTOR data used for my analysis, along with other NBA statistics, for every player grouped by team, season and season_type (regular season, playoffs) since 2014. 

The "FiveThirtyEight" website and Github contain NBA data (historical & latest) with descriptions for statistic and each constructed variable, as well as interactive plots/widgets that allow the user to assess various statistical trends and patterns among NBA players. 

This is the link to their website: [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)

This is the link to their Github repository: [538RaptorData](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-raptor)


Have fun! :)
