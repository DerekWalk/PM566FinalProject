**Topic:** Relationship Between Minutes Played and Total RAPTOR Score Among NBA Players During the Regular Season (2014-2022)

**Brief Overview:** Every year, FiveThirtyEight (538), an American organization that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging in the United States, produces a statistical data report that assesses NBA team and player performance each season, and predicts statistics and trends for the new year. Through use of these "538" data, we observed and assessed the relationship between player minutes played in the regular season and total RAPTOR score, a metric created by "538" that makes use of a players box score and "on-off" components to assess the performance level of a particular player. These data provided include information for every player by season since 2014. In our assessment we found there to be a moderately positive association between the number of minutes a player played and their total RAPTOR score. This website congregates our results and offers insight into our approach.
